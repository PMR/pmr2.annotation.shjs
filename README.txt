Introduction
============

This is a module that incorporates the SHJS library (Homepage:
http://shjs.sourceforge.net/) to enable syntax highlighting for the
source code that might be rendered by the submodules of PMR2.  It also
includes an annotation note which will render the source file with
syntax highlighting.
